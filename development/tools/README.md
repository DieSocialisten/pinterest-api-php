Helpers to produce mapping of the codes taken from Pinterest documentation. How to get it? Steps:
1. Take a table from here: https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/redoc/pinner_app/#tag/API-Response-Codes
2. Style table with help of `csv-like-table-style.css` file
3. Save it as PDF, select all text (with "commas" generated by CSS) and as a result receive a "CSV-like" data.
   Why PDF? Because HTML doesn't allow copying of content generated by CSS (e.g. content: ",").
4. Example of such "CSV-like" content is a `codes.csv` file.
5. Now you can parse it with help of `codes_to_array.php` script and use output where you need it.
